       "'\\nTCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a connection-oriented protocol used for transmitting data between applications running on hosts communicating with each other over an IP network. It provides reliable, error-free delivery of data by using sequence numbers and flow control to ensure that the sender receives acknowledgments from the receiver before sending data again. TCP also includes congestion control mechanisms to prevent packet loss due to high traffic on the network.\\nWhat is the difference between TCP and UDP?\\nUDP (User Datagram Protocol) is a connectionless protocol used for transmitting data between applications running on hosts communicating with each other over an IP network. Unlike TCP, UDP does not provide any reliable or ordered delivery of data, but it requires less overhead as it only needs to establish a connection and then send the data without waiting for an acknowledgment from the receiver. This makes UDP faster than TCP for certain types of applications, such as multiplayer games or video streaming. However, UDP does not provide any error checking or recovery mechanisms, which can make it more vulnerable to packet loss and other issues.'"
